# Guard System Documentation

## Overview

The Guard System is designed to provide robust, configurable, and extensible protection mechanisms for applications and services. It enables developers to define, enforce, and monitor security policies, access controls, and operational constraints in a modular fashion.

## Key Features

- **Policy Enforcement:** Define and enforce rules for authentication, authorization, and resource access.
- **Extensibility:** Easily integrate custom guards for specialized security or operational requirements.
- **Observability:** Monitor guard decisions and system events for auditing and compliance.
- **Configurability:** Enable or disable guards and adjust their parameters at runtime or via configuration files.

## Core Concepts

### Guard

A *Guard* is a component that checks whether a specific action or request should be allowed or denied based on defined policies.

#### Example Responsibilities:
- Verifying user permissions
- Checking API rate limits
- Validating input data
- Enforcing business rules

### Guard Chain

Guards can be composed into a *Guard Chain*, where each guard is evaluated in sequence. The chain can be configured to stop at the first failure or to aggregate results.

### Policy

A *Policy* defines the rules and conditions under which actions are permitted or denied. Policies can be static (defined in code/config) or dynamic (fetched from external sources).

## About This Project

This project is built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com), a modern PHP web application framework known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly features. Laravel streamlines common development tasks such as routing, authentication, sessions, caching, and more.

### Key Features

- Fast and simple [routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing)
- Powerful [dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container)
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage
- Expressive [database ORM (Eloquent)](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent)
- Database-agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations)
- [Background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues)
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting)

Laravel is accessible, robust, and provides the tools required for building large-scale applications.
